ex_1_runtime_parsing.json contains a list of entries representing runtime of specific operation in associated software. 

Write a program in Python which:
- accepts as an input json file,
- parses the the file, calculates and prints:
    - operation, which is taking the longest when summed from all entries,
    - list of softwares from the one taking the longest, to the one running the shortest.
        
What kind of error handling would you implement? What should be done about invalid entries?
